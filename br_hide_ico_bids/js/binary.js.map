Add the script data to getScript() method\n */\n\nconst Guide = (() => {\n    let opt,\n        cookie_name,\n        btn_next,\n        btn_finish;\n\n    const init = (options) => {\n        opt = {\n            script        : '',      // the script name in scripts\n            autoStart     : false,   // false: start by button click\n            guideBtnID    : '#guideBtn',\n            btnText       : localize('Guide'),  // guide start button's text\n            blink_class   : 'highlight',\n            blink_inDelay : 1000,\n            blink_outDelay: 1000,\n            blink_interval: 3000,    // 0: continous blinking (blink_inDelay + blink_outDelay)\n            blink_count   : 0,        // 0: infinite\n        };\n        $.extend(true, opt, options);\n\n        cookie_name = 'hide_guide';\n        btn_next    = { className: 'button', html: $('<span/>', { text: localize('Next') }) };\n        btn_finish  = { className: 'button btnFinish', html: $('<span/>', { text: localize('Finish') }) };\n\n        if ($(opt.guideBtnID).length === 0 || opt.script.length === 0) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        if (isDisabled()) {\n            $(opt.guideBtnID).remove();\n            return;\n        }\n\n        makeButton();\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  do not show the guide button if its close (X) has been clicked before\n     */\n    const isDisabled = () => {\n        const disabled = Cookies.get(cookie_name);\n        return !!disabled && $.inArray(opt.script, disabled.split(',')) >= 0;\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  handle the guide button appearance using a cookie for all scripts\n     */\n    const setDisabled = () => {\n        if (!isDisabled()) {\n            const disabled = Cookies.get(cookie_name);\n            Cookies.set(cookie_name, (!disabled ? opt.script : `${disabled},${opt.script}`));\n        }\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  generate the button's html\n     */\n    const makeButton = () => {\n        if ($(opt.guideBtnID).children().length > 0) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $(opt.guideBtnID)\n            .addClass('gr-hide-m pulser')\n            .append($('<span/>', { class: 'close', text: 'X' }))\n            .append($('<strong/>'));\n        $(`${opt.guideBtnID} strong`).html(`<span></span>${opt.btnText}`);\n\n        setEvents();\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  both buttons' click event\n     */\n    const setEvents = () => {\n        $(`${opt.guideBtnID} strong`).click(() => {\n            const enjoyhint_instance = new EnjoyHint({});\n            enjoyhint_instance.setScript(getScript(opt.script));\n            enjoyhint_instance.runScript();\n        });\n\n        if (opt.autoStart) {\n            $(opt.guideBtnID).click();\n        }\n\n        // Hide button\n        $(`${opt.guideBtnID} span.close`).click(() => {\n            setDisabled();\n            $(opt.guideBtnID).remove();\n        });\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  each page's script\n     */\n    const getScript = (script_name) => {\n        if (script_name !== 'trading') {\n            return null;\n        }\n        return [\n            {\n                selector   : '#contract_markets',\n                description: `<h1>${localize('Step')} 1</h1>${localize('Select your market')}`,\n                event_type : 'next',\n                nextButton : btn_next,\n            },\n            {\n                selector   : '#underlying',\n                description: `<h1>${localize('Step')} 2</h1>${localize('Select your underlying asset')}`,\n                event_type : 'next',\n                nextButton : btn_next,\n            },\n            {\n                selector   : '#contract_form_name_nav',\n                description: `<h1>${localize('Step')} 3</h1>${localize('Select your trade type')}`,\n                event_type : 'next',\n                nextButton : btn_next,\n            },\n            {\n                selector   : '#websocket_form',\n                description: `<h1>${localize('Step')} 4</h1>${localize('Adjust trade parameters')}`,\n                event_type : 'next',\n                nextButton : btn_next,\n            },\n            {\n                selector   : '#contracts_list',\n                description: `<h1>${localize('Step')} 5</h1>${localize('Predict the direction<br />and purchase')}`,\n                event_type : 'next',\n                nextButton : btn_finish,\n            },\n        ];\n    };\n\n\n    return {\n        init,\n    };\n})();\n\nmodule.exports = Guide;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/javascript/binary/common_functions/guide.js","const Client         = require('../base/client');\nconst CookieStorage  = require('../base/storage').CookieStorage;\nconst LocalStore     = require('../base/storage').LocalStore;\nconst Url            = require('../base/url');\nconst AffiliatePopup = require('../../binary_japan/affiliate_popup');\n\n/*\n * Handles utm parameters/referrer to use on signup\n *\n * Priorities:\n * 1.
